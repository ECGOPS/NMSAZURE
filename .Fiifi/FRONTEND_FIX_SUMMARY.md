# 🔧 Frontend Authentication Fix - COMPLETED

## ✅ **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

### **Root Cause:**
The frontend was **hardcoding user roles as 'system_admin'** in the `handleUserLogin` function, which meant:
- New users with 'pending' roles were being treated as 'system_admin'
- They bypassed the pending approval page and went directly to dashboard
- The backend was correctly creating users with 'pending' roles, but frontend ignored it

### **What Was Fixed:**

1. **🔧 Updated Frontend Authentication Logic** in `src/contexts/AzureADAuthContext.tsx`:
   - **Changed initial role** from `'system_admin'` to `'pending'`
   - **Added backend API call** to fetch actual user role from `/api/users/me`
   - **Proper error handling** for cases where user doesn't exist yet

2. **🔧 Added Backend Endpoint** in `backend/routes/users.js`:
   - **New `/api/users/me` endpoint** to get current user's profile
   - **Uses authentication middleware** to get user ID from JWT
   - **Returns actual user data** from database

### **New Authentication Flow:**

```javascript
// OLD (Problematic):
role: 'system_admin' as UserRole, // ← Always system_admin!

// NEW (Fixed):
role: 'pending' as UserRole, // ← Start with pending
// Then fetch actual role from backend:
const response = await fetch(`/api/users/me`, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
const backendUser = await response.json();
role: backendUser.role || 'pending', // ← Actual role from backend
```

### **How It Works Now:**

1. **User logs in** → Frontend creates user with 'pending' role initially
2. **Frontend calls backend** → `/api/users/me` to get actual user data
3. **Backend returns role** → 'pending', 'district_engineer', 'system_admin', etc.
4. **Frontend updates user** → With actual role from backend
5. **ProtectedRoute checks** → If role is 'pending', redirects to pending approval page
6. **User sees correct page** → Pending approval page for new users, dashboard for approved users

### **Benefits:**

✅ **New users get 'pending' role** and see pending approval page
✅ **Existing users keep their proper roles** and go to dashboard
✅ **No more bypassing approval process**
✅ **Proper role-based access control**
✅ **Backward compatible** with existing users

### **Testing:**

- **New users** should now see the pending approval page
- **Existing users** should go directly to dashboard
- **Admins** can approve pending users through user management
- **Role-based access** should work correctly
