# Overhead Line Inspection Caching Solution

## Problem
The overhead line inspection page was using server-side pagination without any caching mechanism. When users navigated to different pages and then returned, the data would be lost and they would have to wait for it to load again from the server.

Additionally, intermittent 500 Internal Server Errors were occurring, causing poor user experience.

## Solution
Implemented a page-level caching system for overhead line inspections with the following features:

### 1. Page-Level Caching
- Each page of data is cached separately with a unique key based on:
  - Page number
  - Applied filters (date, month, region, district, feeder)
  - User role and permissions
  - User's district/region

### 2. Retry Logic for Intermittent Errors
- **Automatic Retry**: Automatically retries failed requests up to 3 times
- **Exponential Backoff**: 1s, 2s, 4s delays between retries
- **Error Detection**: Specifically handles 500 Internal Server Errors
- **Fallback to Cache**: Shows cached data if server is unavailable
- **Visual Feedback**: Connection status indicators for users

### 3. Cache Key Structure
```
overheadLineInspections_page_{JSON.stringify(filterParams)}
```

Where `filterParams` includes:
- `page`: Current page number
- `date`: Selected date filter
- `month`: Selected month filter
- `region`: Selected region filter
- `district`: Selected district filter
- `feeder`: Selected feeder filter
- `userRole`: User's role
- `userDistrict`: User's district
- `userRegion`: User's region

### 4. Cache Duration
- Cache entries expire after 5 minutes
- This ensures data stays fresh while providing good performance

### 5. Cache Invalidation
Cache is automatically cleared when:
- Filters are changed
- An inspection is added, updated, or deleted
- User manually refreshes the data

### 6. User Experience Improvements
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows when data is loaded from cache vs server
- **Connection Status**: Real-time connection status indicators
- **Retry Button**: Manual retry option when connection fails
- **Refresh Button**: Allows manual cache clearing and data refresh
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data fetch
- **Cache Status**: Shows "📋 Cached" indicator in pagination area
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to cached data

### 7. Performance Benefits
- **Faster Navigation**: Returning to previously visited pages is instant
- **Reduced Server Load**: Fewer API calls for repeated page visits
- **Better UX**: No waiting time when navigating back to cached pages
- **Resilience**: Handles intermittent server errors gracefully

## Implementation Details

### Cache Storage
- Uses the existing IndexedDB cache system (`src/utils/cache.ts`)
- Cache entries include:
  - `records`: Array of inspection records
  - `total`: Total number of records
  - `timestamp`: When the data was cached

### Retry Logic
```typescript
// Retry logic for intermittent 500 errors
if (retryCount < 3 && (error.message?.includes('500') || error.message?.includes('Internal Server Error'))) {
  const retryDelay = Math.pow(2, retryCount) * 1000; // Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s
  console.log(`[OverheadLineInspectionPage] Retrying page ${page} in ${retryDelay}ms (attempt ${retryCount + 1}/3)`);
  
  setConnectionStatus('retrying');
  setTimeout(() => {
    loadPageData(page, retryCount + 1);
  }, retryDelay);
  return;
}
```

### Connection Status Indicators
- **🔄 Retrying**: Shows when automatic retry is in progress
- **⚠️ Connection Error**: Shows when connection issues are detected
- **📋 Cached**: Shows when data is loaded from cache
- **Manual Retry Button**: Appears when connection fails

### Cache Management
```typescript
// Generate cache key for current page and filters
const getCacheKey = (page: number) => {
  const filterParams = {
    page,
    date: selectedDate?.toISOString().split('T')[0] || null,
    month: selectedMonth?.toISOString().split('T')[0].substring(0, 7) || null,
    region: selectedRegion,
    district: selectedDistrict,
    feeder: selectedFeeder,
    userRole: user?.role,
    userDistrict: user?.district,
    userRegion: user?.region
  };
  return `overheadLineInspections_page_${JSON.stringify(filterParams)}`;
};
```

### Cache Clearing
```typescript
const clearPageCache = async () => {
  const cacheInfo = await cache.getInfo();
  const pageCacheKeys = cacheInfo
    .filter(info => info.key.startsWith('overheadLineInspections_page_'))
    .map(info => info.key);
  
  for (const key of pageCacheKeys) {
    await cache.delete(key);
  }
};
```

## Usage

### For Users
1. Navigate to the Overhead Line Inspection page
2. Browse through different pages - data will be cached
3. Navigate away and return - cached data loads instantly
4. If server errors occur, the system will:
   - Automatically retry up to 3 times
   - Show cached data as fallback
   - Display connection status indicators
5. Use the "Refresh" button to clear cache and reload fresh data
6. Use the "Retry Connection" button if connection fails
7. Change filters to automatically clear cache and load new data

### For Developers
- Cache is automatically managed by the page component
- Retry logic handles intermittent 500 errors
- Connection status is tracked and displayed to users
- No additional configuration needed
- Cache keys are automatically generated based on current state
- Cache invalidation happens automatically on data changes

## Benefits
1. **Improved Performance**: Instant page loads for cached data
2. **Better User Experience**: No waiting time when navigating back
3. **Reduced Server Load**: Fewer API calls for repeated visits
4. **Smart Caching**: Only caches what's needed with proper invalidation
5. **Visual Feedback**: Users know when data is cached vs fresh
6. **Error Resilience**: Handles intermittent server errors gracefully
7. **Automatic Recovery**: Retries failed requests with exponential backoff
8. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to cached data when server is unavailable

## Future Enhancements
- Cache preloading for adjacent pages
- Background cache warming
- Cache compression for large datasets
- Cache analytics and monitoring
- Connection health monitoring
- Proactive cache invalidation based on data freshness
